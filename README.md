# References and Borrowing
```rust

# Error Check
## 1.
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

```
Result
```log

8 |     some_string.push_str(", world");

# The rules of References
Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:

- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.
