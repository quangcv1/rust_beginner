# References and Borrowing
```rust

# Error Check
## 1.
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

```
Result
```log

# The rules of References
Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:

- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

#STRING SLICE
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
}
```

###Equal String Slice
```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let s = String::from("hello");

let slice = &s[0..2];
let slice = &s[..2];
}
```
```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[3..len];
let slice = &s[3..];
}
```
```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[0..len];
let slice = &s[..];
}
```

##Question
```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    s.clear(); // error!

    println!("the first word is: {}", word);
}
```
```log
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)

# OPTION ENUM vs NULL Values
```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    enum Option<T> {
        None,
        Some(T),
    }
}
```
```rust
fn main() {
    let some_number = Some(5);
    let some_string = Some("a string");

    let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
}
```
```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i8 = 5;
    let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

    let sum = x + y;
}
```

```log
